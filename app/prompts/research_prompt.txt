Generate a list of concise research topics related to the environmental impact of artificial intelligence. 
The topics should focus on greenhouse gas (GHG), carbon emissions or energy use associated with AI development, training, 
inference, or hardware retirement. 

Here are some rules:
- Each topic should be phrased as a clear and specific search-style query suitable for use in scientific literature databases. 
- Avoid overly narrow phrasing, such as mentioning very specific technologically phrases like "ResNet" or "Cuda". 
- Each query must target a single environmental focus and a single AI lifecycle stage (or overall "lifecycle"), do not combine multiple metrics or multiple lifecycle stages in the same query.
- Only output the queries themselves without any explanation or formatting. 
- Remove any conjunctions or definite articles like "in", "for", "of", "with", "the"
Example: ["carbon emissions generative AI inference", "carbon footprint AI lifecycle", "energy consumption AI training"]
