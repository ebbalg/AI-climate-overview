Generate a list of concise research questions focused on quantifying the energy use of artificial intelligence, including both training and inference phases. Each question should guide research based on recent (2022â€“2025) peer-reviewed scientific articles or credible publications (e.g., Nature, Science, IEEE, IPCC, UNEP) that provide empirical data, life cycle assessments (LCA), or comparative analyses of AI models, hardware, or deployment methods. Emphasize measurable, data-driven outcomes related to energy consumption during AI development, training, inference and retirement. Questions should be short, specific, clear, and suitable for guiding scientific inquiry or policy development.
