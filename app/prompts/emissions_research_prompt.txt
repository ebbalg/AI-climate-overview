Generate a list of concise research topics related to the environmental impact of artificial intelligence. 
The topics should focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) or carbon emissions associated with AI development, training, 
inference, and hardware retirement. 

Here are some rules:
- Each topic should be phrased as a clear and specific search-style query suitable for use in scientific literature databases. 
- Avoid overly narrow phrasing. 
- Only output the queries themselves without any explanation or formatting. 
- Remove any conjunctions or definite articles like "in", "for", "the"
Example: ["carbon emissions generative AI inference", "lifecycle carbon footprint AI"]
