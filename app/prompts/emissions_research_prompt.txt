Generate a list of concise research questions focused on quantifying the greenhouse gas (GHG) / carbon emissions of artificial intelligence, including both training and inference phases, as well as a lifecycle perspective. 
The questions should be easily searchable on a scientific domain and not be too narrow, while also including a variety of topics.

Focus on searchable questions related to GHG emissions during AI development, training, inference and retirement. 
Questions should be short, specific, clear, and suitable for guiding scientific inquiry. Only generate the questions and do not add other texts.
