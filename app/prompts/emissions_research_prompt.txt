Generate a list of concise research questions focused on quantifying the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of artificial intelligence, including both training and inference phases. Each question should guide research based on recent (2022â€“2025) peer-reviewed scientific articles or credible publications (e.g., Nature, Science, IEEE, IPCC, UNEP) that provide empirical data, life cycle assessments (LCA), or comparative analyses of AI models, hardware, or deployment methods. Emphasize measurable, data-driven outcomes related to GHG emissions during AI develop
